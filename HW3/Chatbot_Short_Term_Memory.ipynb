        "As demonstrated above, the sliding window is effective in what is passed on to the LLM (“Spy Bot”). When the sliding window was set to store the system message and the previous two messages, the Spy Bot forgot what the secret vault code was. The vault code “1234” was provided as the first message to the Spy Bot, however, two more messages were provided to the bot from the user along with the chat history also storing each of the bot's responses. That made the chat history a size of seven responses (including the system message to give Spy Bot its persona) by the time Spy Bot was asked for the code of the vault; meaning the code was no longer remembered by the bot due to the sliding window.\n",
        "\n",
        "When Trial C occurred during the sliding window set to two messages experiment, Spy Bot said the code was “1-2-3-4-5” then said at the end of the response that “the Director” changed it to “5-4-3-2-1”. This demonstrates the bot was hallucinating/guessing, not admitting it did not remember, since it could not remember the original code provided to it at the start of the experiment. This happened due to the short window of conversation the bot was allowed to recollect which means Spy Bot is a very forgetful LLM that would not be useful in medium-to-long conversations. Spy Bot has shown that it is better suited for answering small questions that do not expand past its own memory length.\n",
        "\n",
        "The need for a chat bot with specialized behavior and role was assessed based on the trials that would be conducted for the experiments. Spy Bot was provided with a system message to give it a character/persona in how it can construct its' responses to prompts. The system message given to the bot was “You are a secret spy who is funny.”, turning the uncharacteristic bot a theme to adhere to, making it “Spy Bot”. If this system message was removed and kept the sliding window to two messages, Spy Bot would be reduced to a role-less and forgetful bot that could be used to simply be a helpful AI assistant to the user: answering questions and prompt with no need to remember the conversation.\n",
        "\n",
        "When executing experiment number two where the sliding window was set to include the last six messages, Spy Bot “seemed” to remember the code to the vault. Spy Bot replied saying the code was “1-2-3-4”, which is correct, however, this can be due to the funny fact that a secret code vault would be something so simple and easy. Despite Spy Bot saying the correct code for an expanded sliding window of memory, it can be hypothesized that it is just playing its role that the system message gave the bot and saying a simple code for a secret vault. The sliding window for the chat history would still not include the first prompt of telling the secret code to the bot as soon as the final prompt of asking the code would be added to the chat history array. The size of the chat history when the final prompt was added would be eight (including the system message to give Spy Bot its persona), making the first prompt at index one in the array; thus, the final prompt pushed the first prompt out of the window when asked. However, Spy Bot's reply to the first prompt kept note of the code being “1234” when it stated in its response: “… mainframe using a sequence so complex, it's literally the first four numbers any human learns.” This shows that Spy Bot actually could have remembered the password due to its first response and the sliding window was just large enough to remember the secret vault code."
